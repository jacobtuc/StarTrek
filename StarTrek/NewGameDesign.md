###Star Trek...ish

##Description
StarTrek will consist of three levels, each with a different challenge. 

#Level 1: Asteroids
Asteroids will randomly appear and move from the top of the screen toward the bottom of the screen where the player is. The player will be able to move left and right (using the left and right arrow keys) to avoid the asteroids or fire a phaser to destroy an asteroid by pressing the "w" key. If a phaser hits a large asteroid, the asteroid will separate into multiple small asteroids.

#Level 2: Romulans
The enterprise will have to battle a Romulan Warbird. The player an control the Enterprise with the arrow keys to move anywhere on the screen. The Enterprise can fire phasers in 6 directions using the q, w, e, a, s, d, z, x, and c keys to chose a direction. "W" will fire forward, "x" backward, Q North-West (assuming up is North), A to the left, and so on. The Warbird will have a player aware AI and will try to stay to the sides of the Enterprise while firing phasers at it. The player will be able to fire phasers by pressing the space bar.

#Level 3: The Borg
The Enterprise will have to battle a borg ship with the rest of the fleet. The player will not be able to collide with the rest of the fleet, but he or she will lose a life if they collide with the borg. The Enterprise will still be able to use phasers as in level 2. The borg will have three weapons: it can fire a phaser beam; it can lay mines that will explode on contact with any ship; and it can fire missiles that will follow a ship. The borg's focus will not only be on the Enterprise, but on the rest of the fleet as well. The Enterprise's controls are the same as in level 2.

#Scoring and Lives
The player will have three lives. A life will be lost if the player is hit by an asteroid, hit by any borg weapon, collides with the Romulan Warbird, or collides with the borg ship. The player will also lose a life if their strength drops below zero (strength begins at 100 and is decreased by 20 every time the player is hit by a phaser).

When the player loses a life, if the player is on level 1 or 2, the level will restart. If the player is on level three, the player will reappear in the middle of the battle at a random location.

The player will begin with a score of zero. The player will gain 5 points for every asteroid he or she avoids and 10 points for every one he or she destroys. 20 points will be awarded for every time the player hits the Warbird or the borg ship. 15 points will be awarded for destroying one of the borg's missiles or landmines. 500 points will be awarded for destroying the borg ship.
